Books?

Do you have any fears associated with books? I have three. One, I keep running away from textbooks. Second, I fear that even if I managed to read one book a month, I will read very few books over the course of a lifetime. Third, What if I could not read? I was having a reading block and it was pathetic.

As the shutdowns and lockdown continued, Sudarshan kept pushing me to read. He suggested me really good books. I managed to read a few, and here is my pandemic reading list.

**Shoedog** by **Phil Knight,** a seamlessly flowing book. This book is honest and a common book. When we think of Nike, we assume a big story behind the brand. The book, however, is as real as it can be. Knight is inspiring in an optimistic way.

**Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,** is a good book. It is beautifully written which makes it easier for reading. The book was successful to evoke imaginations of the big events in history with atypical stories, opinions and facts. This is a book for everyone.

**Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think** is a book that changes your perspective with reasoning. It questions our assumptions and the ideas we are fixed on. The book is a book of realization, hopefulness and positive world. It opens the difference in the world right in front of us.

**Steve Jobs**, was unexpected. The book is also a book about Apple. It explains important aspects of history and today’s technological development. The book also gave lots of insights in Design and User Experience.

**The Richest Man in Babylon** is a small book that teaches us financial knowledge with a beautiful story woven to it. The book is a book of awareness.

**Animal Farm,** is a nice book relevant to all readers of all age. Its unique storytelling perspective made the book full of life and questions our social norms and values.

Others books I read are Outliers, Losing My Virginity.
